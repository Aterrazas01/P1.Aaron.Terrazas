           Elevator Project


Consider the following elevator images:

Although used every day, the design of the elevator is never considered if it's good or bad. After careful thinking, the elevator design can be improved. 
The elevator design can be improved by having the floor buttons in a single column, not alternating as it currently is. This allows all floors to be together in one column and in proper order. 

The way the panel is laid out, it does do good by having the alarm and emergency call buttons separate from the floor buttons. This prevents accidental presses of the emergency buttons. Additionally, the black spaces next to each button is a great addition as it clearly indicates what each button is for. Once again however, the cramped alternating design makes this elevator design poor

The most commonly used buttons in the elevator are:
- First Floor Button
- Basement Button
- Close Door Button

The least used buttons in the elevator are:
- Alarm Button
- Emergency Call Button

Since these items are separated, it's very easy to use the common buttons.

The design of the elevator is very simplistic and minimalistic, So the sequence to use the elevator is as follows:
-1:  Press the exterior button to go up
-2:  Press the floor you wish to go to
-3:  Press the close door button

Since the elevator is very minimalistic, there is no instructions on how to use the elevator, however it does provide feedback by having an indicator on which floor you're on. 

While it may be simple already, the design can be improved to as such:

Using the sketch, the working version of the elevator would look as such:
