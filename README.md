Consider the following elevator images:

Although used every day, the design of the elevator is never considered if it's good or bad. After careful thinking, the elevator design can be improved. 
The elevator design can be improved by having the floor buttons in a single column, not alternating as it currently is. This allows all floors to be together in one row and in proper order. 

The way the panel is laid out, it does do good by having the alarm and emergency call buttons separate from the floor buttons. This prevents accidental presses of the emergency buttons. Additionally, the black spaces next to each button is a great addition as it clearly indicates what each button is for. Once again however, the crampped alternating design makes this elevator design poor
